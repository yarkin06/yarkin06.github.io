I am a Ph.D. candidate in ECE at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/) under the advisory of [Prof. Stratis Ioannidis](https://ece.northeastern.edu/fac-ece/ioannidis/). I have obtained my B.Sc. degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from [Bilkent University](https://ee.bilkent.edu.tr/en/).

My research is focused on efficient implementation of deep neural network mapping and pruning for distributed inference, as well as optimal data selection strategies for re-training ML models to maintain predictive performance in the presence of concept drifts.
